I’m Arshia, a third-year Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at EPFL advised by Professors Volkan Cevher and Mahsa Shoaran. My research explores efficient and fast LLMs by merging deep learning architectures with systems.

Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology and earned a Bronze Medal at the 2018 International Physics Olympiad 🥉 and Gold medal of National Physics Olympiad 🥇. 

Beyond academics, I’m a passionate rock climber 🧗‍♂️ and pianist 🎹! :)
